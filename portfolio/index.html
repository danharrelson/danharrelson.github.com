			<div class="span-24"><h1>Hi, I'm Dan</h1></div>
			<div class="span-11">
			Thanks for taking a peek at my portfolio. Hopefully these work samples give you a taste for who I am and what I do. There's much, much more and I'd be happy to fill in details and gaps; just let me know when you'd like to <a href="mailto:dan@harrelson.me">chat</a>.<br /><br />
				
			Throughout my career I have <a href="#work">worked</a> at the intersection of design & development. Starting early during my education in print design and throughout my career working in digital media, the interweaving of design and implementation always just felt right. I've been lucky enough to earn many unique opportunities to share this view with others through leadership, <a href="#ideas">writing</a> and <a href="#ideas">speaking</a>.<br /><br />
				
			<a href="#background">Over the last 20+ years</a> I have designed interfaces, architected systems, built apps, lead teams and consulted with many, many <a href="images/logos.png" class="special">fortune 500 clients</a>. Why the variety? Because I like a challenge. Being pushed into new places is exciting; I want to always be learning. Maybe it's experimenting with new technology like machine learning. Maybe it's learning a technique for user research. Maybe it's finding out about a new culture. Maybe it's designing for a brand new device. I find that my best ideas emerge when collaborating with smart people, in respectful and creative environments.

				<div class="span-10 clear">I lead technology strategy for a 10 month research and UX design engagement. The team was tasked to radically re-think the consumer app used to manage a 401k account. As a key team member I participated in primary research with client stakeholders, consumers and financial advisors. We turned this research data into concepts and tested the ideas with real customers. With strong, vetted concepts we conducted detailed design and I built a prototype for user testing. The final deliverable was a working prototype used by the client engineering team to build the final product and sell the ideas internally.</div>

				<div class="span-10 clear">Over the course of six months I lead a team of designers and engineers to refresh the primary source of information for webOS developers. Before designing a single screen or writing a line of code we spoke to HP stakeholders and actual developers. This set up the team with a strong strategic approach on which to build something great. The visual design of the site needed to come together within an evolving brand: Palm was being turned into HP webOS. Given our target audience (cutting edge developers) we had the freedom to push the front-end of the site to leverage some of the best from CSS3 and HTML5. Behind the scenes a new content management system (CMS) was introduced. I managed a team of 5+ people to launch the site on time.</div>

As the primary resource to find small businesses in the UK, Yell wanted to offer affordable website creation service to these SMB's. We embarked on a 2 month research program. While still in San Francisco, I came up to speed on Yell's core business offering and the problem they wished to solve. This was followed by two weeks spent on-the-ground in the UK making visits to a dozen business owner's homes and offices. Each research participant walked through a series of activities intended to reveal how they market services and what they consider to be "great design". Findings from this ethnographic study were analyzed and ultimately I delivered a report including actionable design direction for Yell's offshore site builders.</div>

Turning research findings into design principles we developed a new strategy for the site's success. We then created a new information architecture and a detailed set of wireframes defining key interaction patterns and full screen designs. Finally, a complete visual design and style guide was provided for implementation.

I've also presented a <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.org/ideas/what-makes-a-design-technologist/">definition for a design technologist</a>, a call to action for <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.org/ideas/open-source-design/">better design in open-source software</a> and I predicted that <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.org/ideas/the-death-of-mobile-applications/">mobile apps would NOT die</a> well before we saw the amazing success of the iPhone app store.

				<div class="span-10"><h4>Sr. UX Design Director</h4></div>
		        <div class="span-6 last"><em>2011 thru Present</em></div>
				<div class="span-18">I currently lead a talented team of around 40 individuals working on the user experience (UX) aspects of the <a href="http://predix.io">Predix</a> platform. This includes both individual contributors and managers.<br /><br />

The mission of Predix UX is the delivery of our developer experience strategy. For example, my team oversees all aspects of our customer-centric predix.io web application. I also lead the design of products such as EdgeManager and analytics workbenches in support of the Predix edge and Digital Twin initiatives.<br /><br />

We are successful not by solely designing products, but also partnering with product management and engineering leadership. The bulk of the platform UX is under my oversight, so I direct designers who are contributing to many scrum teams. We work on software for managing devices that go into plants, software that ensures applications are secure, software that enables efficient data management and software that executes complex analytical algorithms.<br /><br />

As the leader of a large team I am responsible for ensuring their professional success. I work with individual designers and developers to grow their careers. Talent management includes retaining the best people and recruiting new designers when needed. Recently I have taken the lead role of connecting GE Digital with California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly).<br/ ><br />

				<div class="span-10"><h4>UX Design Director</h4></div>
					
As a Design Director for GE Software I lead user experience engagements for our Energy Management business. This included the UX design for field force (mobile) applications, controls HMI, power grid management and more.<br /><br />

I also lead projects with what is now called Current by GE, a new business intended to “reboot” GE’s legacy lighting business with Internet technology.<br/ ><br />

				<div class="span-8 clear"></div>
				<div class="span-10"><h4>Design Technology Lead</h4></div>
									
As a member of Global Research and GE Software I assumed a leadership role in forming and shaping the UX Center of Excellence (CoE). I was responsible for the technology that powered GE Software’s high quality and next generation user experience. In this role I worked with teams across the globe to assess needs for UX technology within a diversity of projects.<br /><br />

I oversaw the maintenance of GE’s design systems. This includes technology selection, feature prioritization, gathering customer feedback, managing an Agile development process and release management. I had also been put in charge of the visualization module of GE Software’s platform, asked to do so on behest of the CTO based on my experience and success.

				<div class="span-10"><h4>Executive Director of Technology</h4></div>
		        <div class="span-6 last"><em>2010 thru 2011</em></div>
				<div class="span-18">I joined <a href="http://hotstudio.com/">HotStudio</a> after the company had made a strategic decision to build a strong engineering capability. I came on board as a Director and was promoted to Executive Director in June of 2011. I grew our Technology practice from a team of 3 to a team of over 12 by defining the roles that we need and hiring qualified engineers. I also established relationships with professional development companies with whom we partner on projects. In the 1 year since I have been with Hot Studio our work has changed dramatically. Half of our projects are now based on strategic alignment of technology with UX and business needs. We are developing complex software using internal staff. All of this has resulted in a 60% increase in the company's revenue for 2011.<br /><br />

At Hot Studio I have shaped the company's perspective around UI engineering. I've built a team and lead projects that leverage HTML5 and advanced JavaScript to deliver complex software. We are using HTML5 to create compelling experiences on computers, tablets and smartphones. We're building web applications that are used in a browser and we are building stand-alone apps with HTML5 combined with native code for Windows and iOS. I am making a bet that HTML5 is more than just a phase and is going to be the predominant UI platform for all software in the near future. My team is evangelizing this notion within the company, with our clients and with the larger community of design and development practitioners.<br /><br />

I'm a strong advocate for using agile, nimble approaches to design and develop software. We strive to breakdown the traditional waterfall approaches that clients expect from a professional services company like Hot Studio. I have put in place tools to support this and continually educate our staff on Agile techniques.

				<div class="span-18">At <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a> I provided leadership in both design and development, allowing me to help clients realize their product's full potential. As a project lead I was responsible for selling and managing client engagements valued at up to $500k. As a designer, I worked solve problems through user research, experience strategy, and interaction design. As a technologist I often helped to bridge the gap between our design team and client's development team. The building of prototypes is something I strongly believe can help a design process and I often bring rapid prototyping techniques into our client engagements. Mobile devices, consumer electronics, self-service kiosks, web sites and web applications are all mediums in which I've applied my design and development expertise.</div>
